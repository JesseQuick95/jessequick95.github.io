									<h1>Full Profile</h1>
									<p>I am a mechanical engineer, currently finishing my Masters degree specializing in CFD and design optimization. I am passionate about my research in CFD, renewable energy systems, programming, design and art.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/turbines.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/profile_circle.jpg" alt="" /></span>I was born and am currently living in South Africa where I study at the University of Pretoria. I grew up in Krugersdorp Gauteng where I attended Krugersdorp High School. From a young age I was extremely curious and always wanted to know how the world around me works. My curiosity lead me to become interested in learning about the laws of nature through mathematics and science.</p>
								<p>My interest in the hard sciences only grew as I have grown older and followed my interests in multitude a of diverse fields. As my curiosity grew I was no longer satisfied with understanding the world, but I became obsessed with trying to solve these problems. Along the way to address these intellectual needs I found that I could apply my creativity to design solutions for my needs.</p>
								<p>My hunger for knowledge and creativity naturally made me inclined to think innovatively. In my endeavours I found that the only way to scratch my curiosity itch was to study engineering. As of this point the rest is history, I have since worked at developing my skills in these areas and became fascinated with fluid flows and modelling these phenomena with CFD.</p>
								<h2> Education </h2>
								<h3>M.Eng (Mechanical Engineering), University of Pretoria: 01/2019-Present </h3>
